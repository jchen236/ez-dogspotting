1. If you are on OSX and are getting an error like <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:748)>,
it may be because you are using Python 3.6 which does not rely on MacOS's openSSL. You can either run these two commands to install
the certificates which come with the Python installation <cd /Applications/Python\ 3.6/> and <./Install\ Certificates.command>,
or install the certifi package yourself at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi
